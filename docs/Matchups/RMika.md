### Short-Range ###

** Max st.LK Range **

When she doesn't have meter this range isn't too scary. Her main confirm is going to be st.MP into ex.Peach, everything else is going to be a read. That said st.MP alone will give Sakura a really hard time and as soon as you start blocking she's going to find a way to approach.

Personally i'd rather play at Mid-Range where she has 0 options that aren't risky.

Once you have vtrigger she'll be using cr.HP to cancel into vtrigger

### Mid-Range ###

** Max st.Roundhouse Range **

This is the best place for Sakura to be when Mika has meter. You need to stay here and keep her as honest as possible with st.HK, your walk speed should mean you can keep up with her walking back which is important because on whiff she can very easily ex.Peach.

From this range you can react to any of her standard 'party starter' moves - drop kick, dash, cr.Roundhouse and j.RH/jD+MP.

As soon as you force her to be more messured with her offence this is when you can start using your own more offensive agressive options.
