## Quick Notes ##

## <a name="Overview">Overview</a> ##

The most important part of this matchup is to stay at a range where you can punish jab.Straight on block. Although he can out damage you when you're this close, it requires him to have meter and the buttons he'll use mainly are quite laggy (st.Fierce). It is however important that you do not get too complacent, both his jab and v-skill are quick enough to catch you off guard.
